**uFerris** is a versatile, all-in-one learner board designed to:

- Support multiple controllers on a single reference platform.
- Enable programming of standard peripherals (GPIO, Timers/Counters, Analog, PWM, Serial Comms).
- Allow learners to build a complete embedded product replica.
- Serve as a centralized reference for Rust embedded beginners.

### Megalops Power Expansion Board

The Power Expansion Board lets the uFerris baseboard run independently of USB power. It features a 2×AAA battery holder with a current measurement circuit, making it easy to measure current consumption for your projects. It also includes an SD card holder—perfect for learning SPI and storing or logging data directly from your applications.
